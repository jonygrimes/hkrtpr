# HackerTyper for Python

hkrtpr is intended to provide [HackerTyper][hackertyper]-style productivity for any machine with a

Invoke with a source file to control what gets typed to the screen.

  ./hackertyper.py /path/to/src/file.py

TODO:

* add syntax highlighting.  This is not as straightforward as I'd hoped
